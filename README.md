# DiscordQuickMessage
Semester long group project for Software Engineering II at UML

The Discord Quick Message is a Discord bot that allows the user to reply to discord mentions, and not spend a lot of time thinking and typing a response
back to the user. The basics of it is that a person mentions you on a server, and the bot will be able to pick it up, and Direct Message you, and anyone 
else they mentioned, with what they said along with 5 options, 3 choices, along with an ignore button, and a redirect button to redirect you to the message.
Then after selection between the 3 choices there will be a confirmation, in case you made a mistake, and after confirmation the message is sent as a reply
to the aforementioned message. There is also the use of the Discord API, and Discord.net to help aid in making this work on discord, along with OpenAI,
therefore there are tokens needed, but cant be posted here for saftey reasons.
